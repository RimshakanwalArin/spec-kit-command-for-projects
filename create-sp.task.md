# 🌟 **/sp.tasks kya hoti hai?**

**/sp.tasks = project ke har kaam ka list**

Socho:

* Constitution = project ke rules
* /sp.specify = blueprint
* spec.md = detail writing
* /sp.plan = step-by-step plan
* **/sp.tasks = exact kaam jo har member ko karna hai, broken in small tasks**

Yani, **har chhota kaam jo project complete karne ke liye karna hai, woh /sp.tasks me likha jata hai.**

---

# 🌟 **/sp.tasks kyun important hai?**

1. Team ko pata hota hai **kaun kya karega**
2. Kaam **small steps me divide** ho jata hai → easy follow karna
3. Project smoothly finish hota hai
4. Confusion kam ho jati hai
5. SpecKit aur Gemini tools tasks ko follow karte hue generate karte hain content
