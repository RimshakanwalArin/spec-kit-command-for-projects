# 🌟 **/sp.plan KYA hota hai?**

**/sp.plan = aapke project ka complete step-by-step kaam ka schedule.**

Agar spec.md batata hai *kya banana hai*,
to **plan batata hai *kaise aur kis order me banana hai*.**

Yeh basically:

* Timeline
* Tasks
* Steps
* Who will do what
* Project roadmap

sab ek jagah likhta hai.

---

# 🌟 /sp.plan KYUN zaroori hota hai?

Because:

1. Kabhi confusion nahi hoti
2. Team ko pata hota hai next step kya hai
3. Kaam fast hota hai
4. Deadline clear hoti hai
5. Project perfect time par ban jata hai
6. SpecKit isi plan ke mutabiq output generate kar sakta hai

# 🌟 A — Z **/sp.plan me HOTI kya cheezein?**

Main isko 5 parts me asaan banakar samjhaungi:

---

## 1️⃣ **Project Overview (Chota Intro)**

Isme bas short likhte hain:

* Project kis bare me hai
* Goal kya hai
* Deliverables kya hain

Example:

```
project = "AI Textbook"
goal = "School students ke liye easy AI book"
```

---

## 2️⃣ **Timeline (Kab kya hoga)**

Isme weeks ya days me divide karte hain.

Example:

```
[timeline]
week1 = "Research + chapter outline"
week2 = "Chapter writing start"
week3 = "Editing + fixing"
week4 = "Final design + publish"
```

---

## 3️⃣ **Tasks Breakdown (Step-by-step list)**

Ye sabse important part hota hai!
Yahan har kaam details me likhte hain.

Example:

```
[tasks]
1 = "Chapter topics finalize karna"
2 = "Content gather karna"
3 = "Chapters likhna"
4 = "Editor review"
5 = "Design + diagrams"
6 = "Final export"
```

---

## 4️⃣ **Roles + Task Assignment**

Kon task karega?

Example:

```
[assignment]
writer = ["Chapters likhna"]
editor = ["Review + correction"]
designer = ["Diagrams + layout"]
```

---

## 5️⃣ **Milestones (Important Achievements)**

Project ke “checkpoints”—
matlab kaam kab complete maana jayega.

Example:

```
[milestones]
m1 = "Chapter 1 complete"
m2 = "All chapters drafted"
m3 = "Full book edited"
m4 = "Final design approved"
```

---
